Setup
Use npm to install Protractor globally with:

npm install -g protractor
This will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager. Try running protractor --version to make sure it's working.

The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running. Use it to download the necessary binaries with:

webdriver-manager update

Now run the test with

protractor conf.js
